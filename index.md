**FinBERT-LSTM Model:** A 'winning' model over Textblob and BERT when it is applied to predict the movement of stock prices based on price tendancy of the whole market (including Finance, Healthcare, Technology, Energy, Real Estate and Entertainment) ([GitHub](https://github.com/kietngwork/financial-news-sentiment-analysis)).

The study compares:
- A **general sentiment approach** applied across industries  
- **Industry-specific sentiment analysis** to test whether customization improves results

### Proactive Data Breach Risk Management in Healthcare 

My complete implementation of assignments and projects in [***Proactive Data Breach Risk Management in Healthcare***](https://github.com/kietngwork/healthcare-data-breach-risk-nlp/blob/main/healthcare_data_breach_risk_management_NLP_report.pdf).

<div style="text-align: justify">This project applies text mining and NLP techniques to healthcare breach reports to uncover patterns, classify breach severity, and support proactive risk management strategies. We began by cleaning and preprocessing unstructured textual data from 5,370 healthcare breach reports through tokenization and lemmatization. We then utilized Logistic Regression to predict the severity of incidents based on the number of individuals affected. Finally, we applied NER, LDA, and BERTopic modeling to identify frequent entities like Protected Health Information (PHI) and uncover dominant themes such as ransomware attacks and email vulnerabilities.</div>

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/kaggle-house-price/blob/master/ames-house-price.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
